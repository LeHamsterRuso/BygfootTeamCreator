# BygfootTeamCreator
A simple team editor programmed in 2006 (with the knowledge I had at the time) for the game Bygfoot.
BygfootTeamCreator was code with the Java 1.5 SDK, so you need Java 1.5 or above to run the program.

How to build + Run:
javac -source 1.7 -target 1.7  -encoding Windows-1252 *.java
java BygfootTeamCreator 

How to use:
BygfootTeamCreator is an easy way to create files definitions for the game Bygfoot. You only have to write the parameters and save the file as a XML file.
-  Click on "Create" to save a team. Remember to choose a name like team_(the team country)_(the team name).xml
-  To put the team on the game you will need to edit the file "support_files/definitions/(country where the team plays)/(league where the team plays).xml".
